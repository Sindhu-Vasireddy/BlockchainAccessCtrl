## Description

Personal user data is valuable and the main focus of many current business models. However, only service providers collecting data are currently in charge of managing and exploiting it since centralized data storage often prevents users from deciding on their private data in a self-sovereign way. Furthermore, the collection of empirical data on executions of personal data is cumbersome and seldom done.

In this work, we investigate how decentralized technologies (i.e., Blockchain, Solidity), ontologies, and functional languages for executable permission controls (e.g.: eFlint for Smart Contracts) can enable the logging of empirical executions in a privacy-preserving manner. Our contributions are:

1. The eFlint Ontology, mapping eFlint specifications to RDF.
2. An architecture design combining different technologies to demonstrate the feasibility of supporting self-sovereignty in terms of personal data management.
